#While loop (Don't run this - Infinate loop!)

# For loop - Not really used in Ruby
# for n in 1..10
#   puts "#{n} birds on a wire - ha ha ha!"
# end

# While loop
# i = 1
# while i <=10
#   puts "#{i} birds on a wire - ha ha ha!"
#   i += 1
# end

# Until loop 
# until x == 10
#   puts "#{x} birds on a wire - hahaha!"
#   x += 1
# end

# THIS IS A GOOD WAY TO DO LOOPS IN RUBY!  (Times Do loop)
# 5.times do |i|
#   puts "#{i+1} birds on a wire - hahaha!"
# end

# 3.times do
#   puts "She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah!"
# end

# # in this example the first "{" is equivalent to "do" and the "}" is equivalent to "end".
# 2.upto(10){ |n| puts "#{n} birds on a wire - hahaha!" }

# (1..10).each do |popcorn|
#   puts "#{popcorn} kernels of yummy!"
# end
